                  requirements for space-based sensing have dramatically
                  increased the demand for high-bandwidth downlink. However,
                  high data rate RF transceivers still pose significant SWaP
                  and cost restrictions, especially for university-class
                  CubeSat missions. Optical communication may provide a
                  solution to this challenge, enabling data transmission with
                  order-of-magnitude rate increases over RF while being both
                  secure and SWaP-efficient. The Polarization-modUlated Laser
                  Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) is a University of Chicago
                  mission to demonstrate optical downlink at a data rate of up
                  to 10 Mbps using circular polarization shift keying (CPolSK).
                  PULSE-A comprises a <1.5U Optical Transmission Terminal, 3U
                  CubeSat Bus, Optical Ground Station (OGS) employing an
                  amateur telescope, and RF Ground Station (RFGS), all of which
                  are being designed and integrated by a team of over 60
                  undergraduate students. The mission objective is threefold:
                  (1) to provide hands-on educational experiences for
                  undergraduate students, (2) to make hardware for optical
                  communication systems more accessible via open-source design,
                  and (3) to explore the viability and potential advantages of
                  using CPolSK for optical downlink. In this work, we present
                  an overview of the mission, and we describe the PULSE-A
                  Team's learning-oriented approach to program management and
                  engineering. We especially emphasize the importance of
                  student leadership in PULSE-A's development process and the
                  resulting benefits for the University of Chicago community.
                  We also highlight takeaways from the experience of founding
                  and operating an undergraduate student-led CubeSat program.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Barnard's Star is an old, single M dwarf star that
               comprises the second-closest extrasolar system. It has a long
               history of claimed planet detections from both radial velocities
               and astrometry. However, none of these claimed detections have
               so far withstood further scrutiny. Continuing this story,
               extreme precision radial velocity measurements from the ESPRESSO
               instrument have recently been used to identify four new
               sub-Earth-mass planet candidates around Barnard's Star. We
               present here 112 radial velocities of Barnard's Star from the
               MAROON-X instrument that were obtained independently to search
               for planets around this compelling object. The data have a
               typical precision of 30 cm s−1 and are contemporaneous with the
               published ESPRESSO measurements (2021--2023). The MAROON-X data
               on their own confirm planet b (P = 3.154 days) and planet
               candidates c and d (P = 4.124 and 2.340 days, respectively).
               Furthermore, adding the MAROON-X data to the ESPRESSO data
               strengthens the evidence for planet candidate e (P = 6.739
               days), thus leading to its confirmation. The signals from all
               four planets are −1, the minimum masses of the planets range
               from 0.19 to 0.34 M ⊕, and the system is among the most compact
               known among late M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets. The current
               data rule out planets with masses >0.57 M ⊕ (with a 99\%
               detection probability) in Barnard's Star's habitable zone (P =
               10--42 days).",

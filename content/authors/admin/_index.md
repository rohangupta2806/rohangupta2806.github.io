I'm a first year graduate student at the University of Michigan, working with Professor John Monnier. 
I'm interested in both observational astronomy and instrumentation, with a goal of both designing and using cutting-edge instruments to push astronomical discovery.
I also have a strong interest in computer science and machine learning, having completed both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science prior to starting my PhD.
My current work focuses on developing novel techniques to reconstruct images from interferometric data in optical/infrared astronomy. Using these techniques, I aim to study the environments around young stellar objects and understand the processes of star and planet formation. Before starting my PhD, I worked with Professor Jacob Bean at the University of Chicago on improving the stability and precision of MAROON-X, a high-resolution spectrograph for exoplanet detection.
